* Netlify for build + deployment 🌐
* React framework ⚛️
* Vite for the dev server 🚀

## More info on the project 🎓

This project has tested all of my skills that I have accumulated over the course of a year of learning web dev.

Some of the things that had to be done within this project:

* Using asynchronous logic within components
* State management
* Fetching data from a CDN and storing it within a state
* Setting up a database with Supabase, including policies
* Pushing and fetching data from the databases

...and lots more. 

Having focused on the invaluable fundamentals of JavaScript and programming as a whole - some, if not most, of these things I've never done before!
